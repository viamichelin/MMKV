# mmkv\_ohos

The OHOS implementation detail of [`MMKV`][1].

## Usage

Never use it alone. It's NOT a complete set of MMKV functionality. It just provides the FFI implementation needed by MMKV.

This package is [endorsed][2], which means you can simply use `mmkv`
normally. This package will be automatically included in your app when you do,
so you do not need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml`.

However, if you `import` this package to use any of its APIs directly, you
should add it to your `pubspec.yaml` as usual.
